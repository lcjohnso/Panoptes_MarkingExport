# Panoptes_MarkingExport
Tools for exporting marking data from Zooniverse Panoptes classification export CSV to new CSV.

Python script and iPython notebook files available.

Script is currently customized for [AP-AAS229-Test](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lcjohnso/ap-aas229-test) project constructed with Zooniverse's Project Builder for use with AAS299 workshop.  Classification CSV (input) and marking CSV (output) are included in order to allow users to experiment with running the script.

Also Included: Python extraction script for [Planet 9](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/planet-9-rogue-worlds) project -- uses point markers instead of circle markers.
